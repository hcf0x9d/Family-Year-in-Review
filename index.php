/**
 * This will be a Single Page App and will need to be constructed using MVC and
 * OO principals.  For simplicity, it should be flat-file
 *
 * TODO: Setup the schema for controllers and models
 *
 * TODO: Log the goals of the application
 * Before Christmas:
 * 		Users visit, see paperchain items (a la Starbucks holiday free coffee campaign)
 * 			Each day user sees today's item
 * 			User can see previous items, but not future items
 * On Christmas:
 * 		Year highlights available
 * On New Year's Eve @midnight:
 * 		Video is available (Year in review video)
 *
 * Users can:
 * 		Sign up for mailing list -> updates emailed to them
 * 		Share items or a link?
 *
 * Password protected and public versions?
 *
 * TODO: Prototype.  The application itself should be view agnostic (as much as possible)
